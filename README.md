# 🚀 Project Name : WhatsApp 2.0 Clone.

A brief one-sentence description of what this actually solves. 
Built with **React Native**, **Expo**, and **AWS Amplify**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React Native, Expo, React Native Elements
* **Backend: ** AWS:REST and GraphQL
* **Development: Android Studio and Expo.

## 🐳 Getting Started
This project is containerized for environment parity.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone ...`
2. Spin up the Expo App. npx create-expo-app WhatsApp
   
# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

Disclaimer:** Built purely for demonstration of React Native/Expo skills; zero affiliation with the original brand."

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

WhatsApp Clone

- Start building the WhatsApp clone from scratch, starting by setting up a React Native project using Expo all the way to building the backend using AWS Amplify. We will walk through designing the UI layout of the app, structuring everything in components, and putting everything together. We will also implement navigation between screens, header bars, and tab bars for the Whatsapp menu. 

- For the backend, we will be using AWS Amplify, which is an amazing combination of tools and services from AWS, that helps us build mobile and web applications faster. It offers pre-made authentication components and flows, database, API (REST and GraphQL), storage, and much more. We will be using Graphql subscriptions for the real-time chat functionalities

- Doing the Whatsapp clone yourself is a great opportunity to practice React Native, modern Javascript, and AWS Amplify. We are always trying to use the latest technologies and best practices, so that's another opportunity to learn something new, being it functional components, hooks, state, navigations, or AWS and Amplify.
